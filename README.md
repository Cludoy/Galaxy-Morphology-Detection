# Galaxy Morphology Classification with CNN

This project focuses on classifying galaxy morphologies using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning. By leveraging multiple pre-trained models and ensemble methods, we aim to improve the accuracy of classifying galaxies from image datasets like Galaxy DECaLS and SDSS.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `Galaxy_Morphology_Classification.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and predictions.
- `Galaxy Morphology Classification with CNN.pdf`: Detailed project report including methodology, challenges, and results.

## üìä Datasets

We used two publicly available galaxy image datasets derived from the Galaxy Zoo project:

- **Galaxy DECaLS**: [DECaLS Dataset](https://astronn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/galaxy10.html)
- **Galaxy SDSS**: [SDSS Dataset](https://astronn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/galaxy10sdss.html)

## üß™ Methodology

### üîß Preprocessing

- Images resized to `128x128x3` to optimize training speed and memory usage.
- Normalized image pixel values.
- Labels converted to categorical format.
- Addressed class imbalance using class weighting.

### üß† Models Used

Initial experiments were conducted with:

- EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB3, EfficientNetB4
- ResNet50
- InceptionV3
- MobileNetV2

The top-performing models (EfficientNet variants) were chosen for further training and ensemble learning.

### üèóÔ∏è Ensemble Architecture

An ensemble classifier was built using the best three models (EfficientNetB0, B3, B4), which significantly improved overall performance.

## üìà Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-Score**
- **Confusion Matrix**

##  Challenges Faced

- **Hardware limitations**: Limited RAM and GPU time on Google Colab and Kaggle.
- **Class imbalance**: Mitigated using class weights.
- **Generalization**: Mapped class labels across datasets to enable transfer learning.

## üèÅ Conclusion

Our ensemble model achieved a high test accuracy of **83.2%**, outperforming baseline models and showcasing the potential of CNNs with transfer learning in galaxy morphology classification.
